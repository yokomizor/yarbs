# Yokomizor's Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Scripts (YARBS)

This is just a little script I use to bootstrap my hosts.

It is meant to install essential software on fresh Debian based environments.


## Installation

```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yokomizor/yarbs/master/yarbs.sh | sh
```


## Credits

YARBS was first inspired by [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/)'s [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz/).
